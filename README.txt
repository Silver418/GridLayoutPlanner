Grid Layout Planner
v0.10
----------------------------------------------

A tool for planning grid layouts based on draggable furniture & blocked terrain.
The general intent is to be used as a utility for games with a grid-based design element such as Rimworld or Stardew Valley.





KNOWN BUGS
----------
	~Height of the app area does not adjust to large grids. (This will be apparent when grid-resizing is available.)
	~The first time furniture is dragged from the shopping window, it displays under the grid until dropped onto the grid.
	~Widths & heights above the maximum of 6 squares can be entered by typing instaed of using the up/down arrows.
		This can cause furniture in the shopping window	to overflow & cover buttons.
	~"Reset Grid" button only resets terrain, not furniture

PLANNED FEATURES
----------------
	~Custom grid sizes (& grid re-drawing implied thereby)
	~WASD buttons adjusts the size of the window shopping furniture - AD to decrease/increase width, WS to increase/decrease height
	~Give Reset Grid button a confirmation popup, especially before I make it destroy furniture as well as terrain
	~Improve terrain editing - click/drag paint mode at least, separate paint/erase modes


CHANGELOG
---------
v0.10
There is now a grid layout planner.

v0.11
Reset grid button now has a confirmation box and removes furniture + terrain instead of just terrain.
